# 1015MiniProject-Team6_B134

Welcome to Youtube & spotify repository 

About:
This mini project sc1015(Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on youtube and spotify.
For detailed walkthrough, please view the source code in order from:

1.Data Extraction
2.Data cleaning
2.Data Visualization 
3.Linear regression 
4.Random forest
5.neural network regression


Contributors
-Work evenly distributed

Problem Defination
-To Identify what makes a song popular on Spotify and Youtube.
-To identify what are the possible trends between musics and videos on both spotify and youtube platform.
- Which model would be best suited to identify the factors ?



Models Used
1. Linear Regression 
2. random Forest
3. neural network regression

Conclusion
- There are correlations between Loudness and energy 
- There are correlations between Likes, comments 
- There is a very weak corelations between the likes
-  ( beef up abit here) 
- No, we are not able to predict what factors determines the popularity of a music and we can hypothesis that there are other external factors which affects the popularity of the song.

What did we learn from this project?
- Neural Networks, Keras and Tensorflow
- Logistic Regression from sklearn
- API Usage
- Collaborating using GitHub
