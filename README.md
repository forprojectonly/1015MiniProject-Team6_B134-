# 1015MiniProject-Team6_B134-

Welcome to Youtube & spotify repository 

About:
This mini project sc1015(Introduction to 
Data Science and Artificial Intelligence)
 which focuses on youtube and spotify
 For detailed walkthrough, please view the source code in order from:

1.Data Extraction
2.Data cleaning and Visualization 
3.Linear regression 
4.Random forest
5.neural network regression


Contributors
- Chad - Nerual Networks, Data Extraction
- ___ Data visualization, Data  Extraction
- ___ Random Forest, Linear regression

Problem Defination
-To Identify what makes a song popular on Spotify and Youtube
-To identify what are the possible trends between musics and 
videos on both spotify and youtube platform.
-Which model would be best suited to identify the factors



Models Used
1. Linear Regression 
2. random Forest
3. neural network regression

Conclusion
- There are correlations between Loudness and energy 
- There are correlations between Likes, comments 
- There is a very weak coreelations between the likes
- 
-no, we are not able to predict what factors determines the popularity
of a music and we can hypothesis that there are other
external factors which affects the popularity of the prouct

What did we learn from this project?
- Neural Networks, Keras and Tensorflow
- Logistic Regression from sklearn
- API Usage
- Collaborating using GitHub
